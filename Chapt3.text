1. What is URL? Give an example of a URL that shows each components of URL. Diagrammatic representation is more preferred. 
 Ans: A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the internet. It tells the browser where to find a resource (like a webpage, image, video, etc.) and how to retrieve it.
 Example of a URL: 
 | Part             | What it is                          | Example              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Scheme**       | The type of connection              | `https://`           |
| **Domain Name**  | Website name or address             | `www.example.com`    |
| **Port**         | (Optional) Entry gate on the server | `:443`               |
| **Path**         | File/page location on the website   | `/blog/article.html` |
| **Query String** | Extra info sent to the server       | `?search=apple`      |
| **Fragment**     | Jump to a part of the page          | `#top`               |
 
2. URLs vs URIs with examples for each. Can all URLs be URIs? Why?
 Ans: A URL is a type of URI that provides the means to locate a resource on a network, usually the web. It includes a scheme (like http), domain, and path. For example: https://www.example.com/page.html
 
 A URI is a string of characters used to identify a resource either by location, by name, or both. For example: urn:isbn:0451450523

 | Feature  | URI                                         | URL                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Identifies a resource (by name or location) | Locates a resource on the internet    |
| Contains | Name, location, or both                     | Location and access method (protocol) |
| Subset?  | URI is the **superset**                     | URL is a **subset** of URI            |
| Example  | `urn:isbn:0451450523`                       | `https://www.example.com`             |

Yes, all URLs are URIs.
This is because a URL is a specific type of URI that includes information on how to locate the resource. A URI can be:
a URL (location),
a URN (name),
or both.
But not all URIs are URLs, because some URIs only name a resource (like a URN) and do not give its location.
